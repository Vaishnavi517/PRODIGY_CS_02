# PRODIGY_CS_02
# Overview
This project is a simple image encryption tool that utilizes pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images. The tool allows users to perform operations such as swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel. The goal is to provide a straightforward way to understand image encryption concepts through hands-on experience.

## Features
Encrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques.

Decrypt images back to their original form.

Support for basic operations like pixel value swapping and mathematical transformations.

User-friendly command-line interface.
